### Hi there 👋
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python's Data Wrangling, Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Science, and Natural Language Processing.
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
   1 I am a college student learning different programming languages. 👨‍💻
   1 I wish to graduate this year and hope to join the workforce. 🎓
   1 I spend every day learning programming because I do not have the talent like other students. 😞
